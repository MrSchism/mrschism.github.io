### Working on updating

So I finally pulled the trigger.  I'm starting my own development blog.

I've been working on porting games to Linux lately, most recently Relic Hunters Zero.  After that, expect Super Crate Box.  This blog is running in multi-user mode, but only for demonstration purposes.  It'll come in handy over at the [Villainy Studios][1] page.  On that note, we're hoping to drop the money for the hundred bucks to develop on Steam.
